Reinforcement Learning for Asteroids game ([play](https://freeasteroids.org/))

Group members: Cade, Quan, and Carrington

Plan:
1. Game src code: Use Gym for [game environment](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/atari/asteroids/)
1. Reward function
1. Create [Q-model on Keras](https://keras.io/examples/rl/deep_q_network_breakout/)
1. If q-model ineffective / easy to implement:
1. modify amount of layers and etc.
2. Try different models and compare effectiveness with Q-model
